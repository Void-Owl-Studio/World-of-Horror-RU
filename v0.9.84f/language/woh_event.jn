MEDICAL TRIAL|984
You blend in with the hospital staff and make your way into an unmarked ward, where a particular patient catches your eye. They look to be catatonic, eyes glazed over, shallow breathing, but of most interest are the irregular growths along the abdomen.##You wouldn't be much of a nurse if you ignored them, right? They need help.
inspect the patient
excise the growth
You eagerly pull on your spare pair of surgical gloves and probe at the growths, making mental notes about the texture and shape.##When you're back home with your textbooks, you realize that it doesn't match any known diagnosis. Isn't that amazing? You need to do some more digging later.#(+3 EXPERIENCE)
You set your scalpel to work and carefully cut away the tumor-- only for it to immediately regenerate! This needs to be studied further. You pocket a sample of the tissue with breathless glee.

Working quickly but carefully, you manage to excise the protrusions before they can continue spreading. You stitch up the last gashes and escort the man to the hospital.#(+2 REASON / +10 EXPERIENCE)
The protrusions regenerate quicker than you can remove them. You're useless as they spread up his arm, and then suddenly burst from his heart, spurting a geyser of black as the man convulses, before finally falling dead.##Well, that didn't work.#(-2 REASON)
As you explain what must be done, the man's face pales, but he agrees. You take his tie and use it as a tourniquette, and give him a roll of bandages to bite down on. Then, finally, you proceed with the amputation.#There's a lot of screaming.##You spend some time with the man to ensure that he doesn't go into shock. Despite his immense pain, he's gracious for your help.#(+5% DOOM / +2 REASON)
Realizing the affliction seems familiar, you whip out the tome and flip through the pages. It's some kind of curse! You locate the counter-curse further down the page, and as you speak it, the spines recede back into the man's skin.##As you bandage up the few remaining wounds, he thanks you repeatedly. You simply give him a cheerful smile. This is a job well done.#(+5 REASON)

[let's relax]#You successfully kill the afternoon hitting the waves and hanging out around the boardwalk. As the sun sets, you head home refreshed, though... Are you forgetting something?##Oh! Right, duh. The whole world ending thing. Isn't it funny how easily that slips your mind sometimes? But hey, it was super nice to get some in some 'you time'.#(+2 REASON / +4% DOOM)
(blank line)|1005
DISTANCE|1006
You bump into one of your teammates in the gym. <<Hey, Takahashi>>, she says, looking over you with her brows furrowed, <<Are you doing okay? You've been acting really weird lately, and you look super tired...>>##You shouldn't burden her with everything that's going on. But...
lie
explain yourself
You tell her that you're just stressed out because of finals. She expresses some sympathy and offers to help you study. You say <<sure>>, but it's a promise you'll break.##It's better that she doesn't know about it, for her own sake. You can handle this on your own, just like you always do.
You hesitate, but after a deep breath, you tell her what's really going on. Shockingly, she believes you and wants to help. You try to convince her that you're fine on your own, but she's clearly made up her mind. ##You feel guilty letting her get involved, but you know she'll be a big help.#(+ALLY)
You regret it as soon as you open your mouth. She looks at you like you're crazy. You pretend it was a joke and leave quickly.
WORKOUT ROUTINE|1013
<<Takahashi!>> you hear a chipper voice shout during a jog around the area. You turn your head to see another one of your teammates in casual clothes, smiling. Blissfully unaware of everything going on.##<<What's up, Captain?>>
<<come jog with me!>>
<<notice anything weird recently?>>
After a bit of playful coaxing, you convince her to join you for another lap or two. The extra competition motivates you to push yourself harder. You wrap up your workout tired, but satisfied with yourself.|(-1 STAMINA / +2 REASON)
She tilts her head and presses a finger to her chin, thinking hard. Then with a tiny <<oh!>>, she begins telling you a strange story from the other day.|(+10 EXPERIENCE)
She shakes her head, throwing up her hands in a shrug.#<<What makes you ask? Something wrong?>>##You tell her not to worry about it too much. You part ways shortly after that.
MIDNIGHT DRIVER|1020
After a long night without much sleep, you decide to go for a ride along the coast to clear your head. But it's hard not to think about the night that started everything. Behind this same wheel, driving like hell after watching your brothers in arms get slaughtered, and not doing a damn thing to save them.##You were a coward.#(+5 EXPERIENCE / -1 REASON)
but not anymore
CATCHING UP|1023|
You're stopped dead in your tracks by the feeling of cold metal against your back. You look over your shoulder.<<Recognize me?>> the yakuza's face sneers.
punch him
go for his weapon
[what the hell?]#You let out a rumbling yell, turning and driving your fist into.. empty air. There's nobody there. He's gone. Your wild swing sends you stumbling and confused.##All of this shit is really starting to get to you... but even if you ran into one of the real guys, they'd probably hate your guts just as much.#(-1 REASON)
You whirl around and grab for the man's weapon. The two of you slam to the ground as you wrestle for it, until you finally manage to tear it from his fingers.##You find yourself with a pistol in your hand and the thug nowhere to be seen.#(+ITEM)
You're too slow. Before you can even turn around, your side explodes with pain. You scream and clutch at the wound, collapsing. There's laughter in your ear as the man's footsteps fade.#(-3 STAMINA)
DEJA VU|1030|
On the other side of the dark hallway, you realize this isn't the same mansion you were in. It's a familiar one, with your car outside, blood dripping down the walls, and *something* hurtling toward you.##This has got to be some kind of sick joke, to put you back here...!
confront it
run the hell away
[you won't be weak anymore]#You're not running away again. You're not going to *let* yourself run away again. Not anymore. Not again. Never, never again. For the sake of everyone you left to die...##You're going to stand and fight, like you always should've...!!
[you were always weak]#You told yourself you'd changed, but here, back in the face of the pressure and the fear all over again, you buckle just the same as you did the first time.##You whirl around and barrel down the hallway with all the strength you've got, just like the coward you've always been.(-2 STAMINA / -2 REASON)
WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE|1036|	
You pace back and forth beside your desk, piled high with photographs, notes, and documents relevant to your investigation.##You're so close to cracking this wide open. You can taste it! But the pieces don't quite fit together. You must still be missing something, but what could it be...?
think it over again
inspect the photos closer
talk to your informant|1040|
You might be looking at this all wrong. Work backwards. Assume you're right, and that everything's connected. Think about what *must* have happened as a result, and find evidence for that. That's what you need.##Determined, you snatch up your camera and set out.#(+7 EXP)
You spend an hour thinking hard, considering things from every perspective you can.##The truth seems so close, but all you get for your troubles is a migraine.#(-1 STAMINA)
There!#You notice a commonality that slipped by you until now, drawing a connection that your theory needed. Now that your theory has its lynchpin, it's time to act.#(+15 EXP)
You look over your photos again, but hold on. You're missing one. Where'd it go? Did you misplace it again?##You pore over your evidence again, and to your horror, you realize there's much more missing than just that photo. Someone's on to you.#(+3% DOOM)
He finds you the whereabouts of a suspect. You corner and interrogate them. Under the pressure, they let a detail slip that all but confirms your theory. You grin.##Bingo!#(+25 EXP)
You're pointed to a man who might have answers. You call him on false pretenses, and agree to meet with him tomorrow night.##The next morning, the news reports his death.##... It must go deeper than you thought. It has to.#(+CURSE)
A FEW QUESTIONS|1047|
You reach the spot where you and the interviewee agreed to meet, and sure enough, she's waiting for you there.##She looks nervous. More than just being alone with you. You're certain she knows something about what happened in that recent missing persons incident.
act intimidating
act friendly
You press her hard for answers, but despite her fear, she doesn't give anything up. But when she rushes to leave, she doesn't notice a peculiar object falling out of her bag.##... Well, she's not making a good case for her innocence.#(+ITEM)
You puff out your chest and try your best to seem tough, but she's clearly not impressed. She doesn't give you any good answers, and the interview is a waste of time. For some reason, these scare tactics rarely work for you.#(+2% DOOM)
You act calmly, sweetly, and like you're a little stupid, goading her into letting her guard down. Before long, she believes you're on her side, and confides in you about the last time she saw the missing person.#(+5 EXP)
Despite your efforts, you fail to assuage her anxiety. She acts tensely through the rest of the interview, and doesn't tell you anything that wasn't already obvious.
DEAD END|1055		
God, you hate work.#(+7% DOOM)##You sure as hell wouldn't be here if you didn't need the money. Putting on a smile and pretending you give a shit makes you want to beat your head against a wall.#Your shift's over now, and you *really* feel like breaking something.
break something
pocket some cash
get back to the investigation
In your first steps out the door, you've already torn off your apron. In the next, you've stormed into the alley, and in a few more, you've walked up to one of the vending machines. You round a kick into the glass, and grin as the shards explode into the air.##You can't remember if the city owns it or if the restaurant does, but either way, it makes you happy.#(+3 REASON)
On your way out, your hand slips into the register and pulls out some pocket change. You're the one doing all the work around here, and you sure need it more than your goddamn boss does.#(+4 FUNDS)
It's not the first time you've done this, and it looks like the old bastard's gotten wise. He's watching you the whole time, so you don't get the chance to steal anything.##You settle for pickpocketing a wallet on the walk home.#(+1 FUNDS)
Well, it's not like you've got time to waste. This is all just shit you have to deal with to get to the end of the day, and the incoming apocalypse isn't gonna be any less of a task master than your boss is. ##That said, between the two, they honestly piss you off about the same amount.#(-3% DOOM)
WATCH IT|1064
Some guy slams his shoulder against you as he walks past, nearly knocking you to the ground. You whirl around and let out a furious <<HEY!>>, catching the attention of the man and a few other passerby. He stares back at you, his eyes dull behind his thick glasses, and his jaw slack and drooling.
terrorize him
what's with this guy?
You threaten him with the nearest thing you can find, screaming your lungs out. He seems to finally wake up, his eyes widening. The bystanders yell and flee, and the man soon follows their lead.#You linger in the street, glancing down at the weapon in your hand with a sigh.#(+5% DOOM / +ITEM)|
You grab up a broken bottle and scream at the man, but he just *stands* there. It's then when you hear shouting behind you-- cops. Cursing, you break for it, running in circles until you can get them off your back.#(+3% DOOM)
Your enraged expresion falters when you realize something's seriously up with this guy. He suddenly lurches forward, crumpling like a puppet with its strings cut. A weird symbol glows on his forehead, and you hear screams from the bystanders as he begins to melt into gore!#Good god, you're gonna be sick...#(-2 STAMINA)
PRICE OF FAME
Passing an alleyway, you notice an old poster on a wall. At first you don't recognize the person presented. Then it hits you.#In the background, there's a mansion. The exact mansion where you...#started your career. ##Someone has written GUILTY in red paint (..blood?) and, sadly, you know what they meant.
tear the poster down
try to forget
With a one swift motion, you tear down the shameful poster. With friends on your side, you _will_ escape your past.#Even if you can't fix it.#(+10 EXPERIENCE / +1 REASON)
Someone has glued countless razor blades behind the poster and they tear through your fingers, staining the shameful poster with blood.##Distressed, you flee.#(-1 STAMINA / -1 REASON)
You touch your side, instinctively.#Though faded and almost invisible, you still can feel the scar under your fingers.#You've been telling everyone about a tree falling accident when you were little but the truth is...#you don't want to know.#(-10 EXPERIENCE / +1 REASON)
FINE PRINT
Mr. YOKOYAMA, your new manager, corners you. The previous one mysteriously disappeared a few months ago.#<<My dearest Mizuki, long time no see>> his breath stinks like rotten meat.#<<Our parent company in Tokyo desperately needs new material. Something thrilling and exciting...>> he smiles.#<<...new blood.>>
shocking tattoo
lengthy photoshoot

[needs at least one ally]
<<Tattoo? Splendid! >>#Mr. YOKOYAMA claps loudly.##<<I even know an artist willing to do a certain design... It might be a bit painful, but I'm sure that everyone will love it.>>#(+STATUS / -2 STAMINA)
<<Yes, yes. I could arrange that.>>#Mr. YOKOYAMA smiles.##<<I'm sure the boss will find that satisfactory...>>#(+5% DOOM)
Mr. YOKOYAMA eyes the person you introduced them to up and down.#<<Yeah... I think we can work with that....>>##You avoid your friend's gaze when they get in a car with your manager, sure you'll never see them again.#(-ALLY)
CRISIS OF FAITH|1087
Allowing yourself a little break, you mind starts to wonder.#Can God really explain everything that you're experiencing?##A dark part of you wonders if the occult you've been fighting can give you the answer you are looking for...
stay strong
what's wrong with doubt
Your steadfast resolve to save this town can come from only one source.#You sigh and prepare yourself for the unknown ahead. #(+4 FAITH)
What if... your God isn't the only one that could influence humans? What if... there are bigger powers at play here?#(-4 FAITH)
MY MEMORIES
Going through your old stuff boxed in your room, you discover an unexpected keepsake. An old rosary bought when you found your faith and a photo of you and your sister at the beach.##You don't have much time to go through other boxes - which memento will you take with you?
an old rosary
photography
You grab the rosary. You'll need all the help you can get if you're to survive in Shiokawa.#(+ITEM)
You grab and photo and place it in your wallet. You'll save this city. For her.#(+10 EXPERIENCE)
CORNUCOPIA
Suddenly, the ONYX MEDALLION begins to shake violently. You try to stop it by pressing it hard to your chest, and it burns your skin.#You yell in pain, catching the attention of a man standing nearby. He takes a step towards you and grabs your hand, clearly trying to help. Help, just like your friends tried to...##Before you can say anything, the man explodes into a cornucopia of blood and gore. The medallion has claimed another victim.
search the remains
flee
Being guided by the medallion's strange powers, you stick your hand into the pile of steaming flesh. The meat fuses with your skin and slowly gets absorbed.#(+2 STAMINA / +5 EXPERIENCE)#(+CURSE)
This can't keep happening!!#You scream, trying to rip the medallion off, but it's no use. You will have to find a way to get rid of it!#(+10 EXPERIENCE)#(+1 CURSE REMOVAL ADDED)
BAD BLOOD
Feeling the wave of nausea coming, you fall on your knees. The liquid you vomit is dark red in color and smells metallic.#When you finally get up, you notice the blood on the floor pools in a certain pattern. The same magic sygil you've drawn during a ritual in which your friends died!##The medallion vibrates a bit, as if happy with the anguish it caused you.#(-1 STAMINA, -5% DOOM)#(+STATUS?)
THE FORBIDDEN COLLECTION
That fateful night, you've only managed to steal NECRONOMICON itself. While extremely dangerous on its own, other titles threatened the safety of this city, too.##What other book do you regret not taking with you the most?
a notebook full of contact information
tome of dangerous spells
a ring binder with details about your life
Yes, having that notebook would help you identify possible threats located in various parts of SHIOKAWA.#(+6 EXPERIENCE)#(LOCATION'S THREAT LEVEL INCREASES)
Yes, the NECRONOMICON can only protect you against threats known to you. Is the pain you're feeling a result of their spells?#(+8 EXPERIENCE)#(-2 STAMINA)
Yes, that ring binder definitely contained too much information about you. You're afraid that the cult will use it to torment you and your family.#(+8 EXPERIENCE)#(-2 REASON)
FUNKY RAMEN
Sitting in a restaurant, you are interrupted by a young waiter.#<<Excuse me, are you Mr. WAKAMATSU?>> she starts.#<<There's someone on the phone asking for you. It seemed to be urgent.>>##Feeling the cold sweat, you follow her behind a counter and pick up the phone. The familiar voice of the club leader greets you and...
he warns you about the ramen you're eating
he demands you return the NECRONOMICON
...wait, you weren't the one who bought ramen. You take a quick glance at a table nearby and quickly flee the restaurant as the man who ordered it falls to the ground, frothing at the mouth.#(+5 EXPERIENCE)
The ramen? Frankly, you thought that it tasted funny but...###You suddenly feel ill as if something was about to explode in your stomach. #The feeling passes after few minutes and you've caused quite a commotion. You excuse everyone and leave the restaurant, hungry and weak.#(-2 STAMINA)
They must be following your every step, getting closer and closer. You flee from the restaurant, excusing the waiter.#(+2% DOOM)
CLIFF'S EDGE
The investigation leads you to an edge of a cliff. The same cliff where you... nevermind, you must focus on the case and saving the town.#Involuntarily, you glance down, expecting to find a half-rotten corpse of a popular girl adored by everyone. Instead, all you can see are the waves crashing violently against the cliff.##God, what's happening to you?#(+5 EXPERIENCE / -2 REASON)
they will find her one day
MY HAIRCUT
Sitting in a bathtub, you spot something and pick it up. It's a pair of scissors. You've used it to cut your own hair. It wasn't a perfect job by any means, but you fooled them. They had a more serious matter to focus on, after all.#(+5 EXPERIENCE / -2 STAMINA)
ECHOES OF THE PAST
Wandering down the dirt paths of the village, you find yourself someplace familiar. You realize this is where you used to live when you were little. As your mind drifts, you wander further down the road. ##You find yourself at the cemetery where Mom is buried.
return to the investigation
leave an offering
dig
[needs 'SHOVEL' item]
You spend a little longer looking over the graveyard before you leave. ##It's been a long while since you thought about Mom. But there'll be plenty of time for it when this is all over.#(+5 EXPERIENCE)
From the nearby temple, you buy incense and flowers. After cleaning the grave and placing your offerings, you spend a few minutes praying. ##You don't remember her, and you were too young. But the way Dad talks about her, you still miss her anyway.#(+2 REASON)
You realize you don't have the money to actually get her an offering. You leave the cemetery, but the guilt still clouds your mind. You end up getting lost due to the distraction.#(+2% DOOM)
... Something overcomes you. Your body moves before you can think better of it, and you plunge your shovel into the foot of her grave. Sweat pours down your face. You dig.##There's nothing. No urn, no ashes, no bones. Nothing. You stare into the dirt, trembling.##What the hell is this?#(+40 EXPERIENCE / -4 REASON)
THE TRUMPETS OF SHIOKAWA
Surely, you can't be the only one who can hear the haunting melody. It can be felt resonating from within everything you touch. The Court's Ball is coming, and you're not ready yet.
prepare yourself
fight this feeling
You will make an excellent addition to the Court.#(+3% DOOM)
Resisting will only make the HERALD work harder.#(-1% DOOM / +INJURY)
CHEERLEADING ROUTINE
A group of students is practicing a cheerleading routine. Weird, you don't recognize the coach - is he new? Thinking nothing else of it, you continue on your way until you overhear something disturbing.##<<KeEp-p prR-acticiNg!
